{
	/// @brief the static class responsible for recieving renderable data structures, managing them, rendering them and supplying the rendered data to the TerminalRenderer instance.
	/// 
	/// list of renderable datastructures are:
	/// Tile
	/// Shader2D
	/// Mesh
	///	
	/// these datastructures can be submitted through various submit functions
	/// @see submitMesh(), submitShader(), submitTile(), submitToQueue()
	///
	/// the datastructures will not be rendered as soon as they are submitted, but only once onUpdate() has returned.
	///
	/// the last rendered frame can be accessed through viewTile().
	///
	///	implementation details:
	/// 
	/// when data is submitted to the renderer, it is pushed into a *render queue* which will be processed at the end of the current application update.
	/// once this point is reached, this queue will be swapped with another queue, which has just been processed.
	/// This new queue will now be the queue which will recieve any newly submitted data.  
	/// 
	/// It is implemented as such in order to allow for rendering and running the application loop at the same time, as this approach enables the application to modify the render queue whilst the renderer is rendering.
	/// 
	/// The render queue are not reallocated at every submit, as AR_RENDER_QUEUE_MARGIN defines how many render objects needs to be added / removed, before the capacity is changed.
	/// 
	/// The last rendered frame is stored seperatly from the TerminalRenderer,
	/// instead of using the already supplied previous rendererd frame, as this frame is not guaranteed to have the correct information.
	///
	/// for example: if the terminal is resized, the last frame will be cleared, whereas the Renderer last frame will be preserved.
	/// 
	/// This also means any functions that reads tiles, is reading from the previously rendered frame instead of the current one.
	///
